Those "little" extras that can make a huge different to you project. Part of the beauty of using Taiga is that you can hypersimple and then build your way up by using more features or more modules. This entry on Taiga Resources will cover three less critical modules that could make your team's life so much easier...

### Taiga Meetup module

Let's start with least impressive of all three but still a convenient add-on for quick project-based video rooms. Under SETTINGS > PROJECT > MODULES, you get the Meetup module. Once you activate it, you're allowed to pick either one of the available free videocall services with a unique URL o add your own shortcut. This will add the Meetup icon to the project's sidebar.  

{{< figure src="/images/meetupconfig.jpg" caption="Meetup module is activated" alt="Meetup module is activated" width="100%" class="articlefigure" >}}

Everyone will be one click away of the "official" online videochat room for the project. It's as simple as that. Don't underestimate this little module, it reduces the typical cognitive load of keeping track of meetup urls yourself.

### Taiga WIKI module

Now, this is much serious stuff. Activating the WIKI module under SETTINGS > PROJECT > MODULES (you expected this by now) brings a small content management system to your project. Here you can directly add wiki pages using the Bookmarks option or use internal link references.

This is important so we will explain a bit how it works. The WIKI module allows you to instantly create WIKI pages with images, tables and all the microformatting you're used to by now. You just need to add any term to your project's wiki url and you will get this:

{{< figure src="/images/wikipage.jpg" caption="URL says *thisisatest* and Taiga suggests a new WIKI page" alt="URL says thisisatest and Taiga suggests a new WIKI page" width="100%" class="articlefigure" >}}

Now, keeping track of all these WIKI pages could be tough so usually what team members do is to create those pages through internal links within other WIKI pages. If you are using the HTML mode, simply add a compact title (no spaces) to the link reference. If you prefer to use markdown mode, it's just the standard [text for a page title](pageslug) snippet.

Taiga will know if the destination page exists already or not. If it doesn't, you'll be prompted with the above message. Edit that page, save it and you're done, that WIKI page is now "solid".

If during your creative process, you feel like you would like to have some WIKI pages readily available as bookmarks, you can simply create a new bookmark and start typing already. Or, if the WIKI page already exists and you want it to be somehow *promoted* to the Bookmarks sidebar, still create the bookmark and enter the WIKI page slug you chose (what appears at the end of the URL), Taiga will understand.

[IMAGEN chula de un wiki page curiosete]

WIKI pages can be **very useful to write documentation, technical or otherwise**. We suggest you break down your content to be very modular and have **many WIKI pages linked together instead of a few textwalls**. Images and other files can be attached to any WIKI Page through drag & drop but also as simple attachments to have handy **below the page content itself**.

What is hidden by default is the WIKI page's changelog. Taiga keeps a fairly comprehensive audit trail of every change for every Taiga item. WIKI pages are no exception and you can inspect all the activity by clicking on the **Activity** banner at the bottom.

That's really all that there is for the WIKI Module. The same Markdown syntax rules or the fantastic Taiga HTML editor make up for the rest of the story, to be honest.

Don't be afraid to deactivate the WIKI Module at any time, it's a non-destructive action. Taiga simply hides all that content from the team but does not delete anything.

### Further reading

Taiga Issues Module has enough intrinsic value to be used alone as the key Module for a particular Taiga project but its true potential arises when used it as a great Scrum or KANBAN companion. There are other Taiga Modules we would briefly cover so you know what you might be missing out. We suggest you read [The Epic, The Wiki and the Meetup](/kaka).
