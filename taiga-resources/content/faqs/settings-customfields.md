Taiga includes optional custom fields in its administration panel. It will provide teams with a flexible input to fit in their workflow.

Users with administration permissions will be able to create new custom fields for their project Epics, User Stories, Subtasks and Issues.

Simply go to your Project Admin section > Attributes > Custom fields and add, remove or edit any of those for your choice of Taiga entities.

You will then be able to see the new custom field option within the Epic, User story, Subtask or Issue view, depending on your choice.

Please note than custom fields cannot be used to filter Taiga items. We plan to add this capability in the future. However, both the API and the live CSV exports do contain the custom fields information.
