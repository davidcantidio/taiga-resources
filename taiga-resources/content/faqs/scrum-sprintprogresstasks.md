Scrum agile technique states that if an estimated user story is not finished, **it can't be counted** towards a sprint's user story points completion.

The rationale is simple, **Scrum sprints care about finished work** that can de properly validated during the **Sprint's Demo**. Partial or unfinished work, while perfectly acknowledgeable, is not meant to change the progress metrics that are geared towards delivered value, not time spent.

This very binary approach frustrates some agile teams that **prefer progress charts to represent any partial progress**.

Some Taiga users have asked to be able to assign points to user stories tasks and keep track of them towards progress. This way, as an example, a user story could be 10 points split up in 2 tasks 5 points each. They would argue that **a finished 5-point task could make the user story 50% finished towards sprint and burndown metrics** even if the user story is not finished.

Product-wise, we continue to evaluate the risks of allowing partial or continuous progress metrics. For the moment, we strongly suggest you read [Agile Antipattern: "All for sprint's speed" in our blog](https://blog.taiga.io/four-agile-antipatterns-and-a-big-fat-lie.html). There are **ways to address the underlying problem** (and need) without the partial-progress approach.
