Although it had an initial emphasis on software development, it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks.\nYou can also say that Scrum allows teams and stakeholders to make sure they are delivering the optimal partial product every time even if it\u0026rsquo;s hard to predict what a final product would look like.\nScrum is probably the go-to Agile framework when teams or organisations decide to try an \u0026ldquo;agile on rails\u0026rdquo; experience for the first time. It is also a lifetime\u0026rsquo;s choice for many agile teams.\nTaiga Scrum module Every Taiga project can activate the Scrum module. This also happens automatically if you chose the Scrum template upon project creation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s optionaly, it\u0026rsquo;s strongly suggested that you enter a number of estimated Sprints (fixed time periods) and the project size in points. If in doubt, you can just input 10 for Expected number of Sprints and 100 for Expected number of story points and come back to change them in the future.\n Project settings for the Scrum module\n  When you do this the project\u0026rsquo;s toolbar will show the Scrum icon and you will be able to access the Project\u0026rsquo;s backlog and any ongoing sprint. By default the Scrum statuses are ones that generally fit the software development process but feel free to change them yourself. You can create your own set of Scrum statuses columns by going to SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; STATUSES and change USER STORY STATUSES.\n Project attributes setup\n  Scroll down to the USER STORY STATUSES and change the default settings to accomodate your particular use case. If you want your user stories to be considered as done when they reach a particular status, flag that status as Closed. This is very important for Scrum metrics and Taiga makes use of it for various Scrum charts so it\u0026rsquo;s good to give it a thought, you can change this at any time. In Scrum you won\u0026rsquo;t typically need to use the Archived flag for a status since the benefit of hiding user stories in that state is not needed here, closed Sprints give you that \u0026ldquo;tidying up\u0026rdquo; mechanism.\nFinally, we suggest you also take a look at the TASK STATUSES right below USER STORY STATUSES and see if you want to change them. Taiga encourages you to split up user stories into maneagable tasks that are usually assigned to just one team member so it\u0026rsquo;s good to select your particular set for more \u0026ldquo;hands-on\u0026rdquo; work items. This has a big impact on how Sprints are managed and viewed as we will later show.\n Project settings related to Task statuses\n  This is the basic setup. You can now go to the Scrum module and start creating user stories in the Backlog prior to adding any new Sprint. You can create one user story at a time and make use of the detailed creation dialog or you can bulk create them and fill in the relevant information at a later time.\nScrum Backlog There are various so called artifacts in Scrum. The top three are the Backlog, the User Stories and the Sprints. They respectively represent what is to be done ordered by priority and readyness, the pieces of work themselves and the fixed time periods in which we put selected User Stories to be worked upon and finished.\nTaiga has two main views for Scrum. The first one is the Scrum Backlog screen. Here you see three major blocks. The Burndown chart (central top pane) which keeps track of your team\u0026rsquo;s velocity, the Backlog (central bottom pane), were future work (User Stories) are frequently added and both open and closed Sprints (right pane).\n Backlog view using the Scrum module\n  This Backlog view conveys a lot of information but Taiga tries to make the visual and mental loads easy to cope with. We can\u0026rsquo;t fast forward this process for you but we can help you understand how all three blocks are related to one another at any stage of the project.\nThe Backlog or Product Backlog can grow indefinetly as long as the top placed user stories enjoy highest priority and are \u0026ldquo;ready\u0026rdquo; to start working on then. You can arrange user story priorities by simply dragging and dropping them in the Backlog. Click on single user stories to fill in all the relevant information so the team can decide they are ready for an upcoming sprint. It is somewhat challenging to consider a user story ready for a Sprint if the team hasn\u0026rsquo;t at least filled in Title, Description and Points. Optional but really valuable are the user story\u0026rsquo;s tasks and attachments or custom fields.\nUser Story Points in Taiga are a measure of the overall complexity of a User Story. Take advantage of Taiga cross-functional capabilities to set up which team roles are allowed to partially contribute to the total user story points. You can do that under SETTINGS \u0026gt; PERMISSIONS when you activate the estimation flag for a selection of your team roles. User Story points are one of the most challenging aspects of Scrum, be sure to read Scrum, the Dark Side.\nNote that you can have different user stories statuses applicable when they belong to the Backlog. The three most common Backlog-friendly user story statuses are something like New, Ready or Needs info. The remaining of the user stories workflow typically happen within a Sprint.\nNext, under the Sprints pane, create a new Sprint, select a descriptive title and start and end dates. You can assign user stories from the Backlog to this Sprint by dragging and dropping them. If you multiple-select various user stories in the backlog, you can drag and drop them together after multiple-selecting them or use the handy \u0026ldquo;Move to Current Sprint\u0026rdquo; action.\n An example of an already filled-in ongoing sprint\n  Congratulations! You have your first Sprint set up for work!\nThe Burndown chart will still look a bit boring but that will change the moment user stories are closed. This chart\u0026rsquo;s role is quite simple and yet crucial. It will show how much progress in terms of closed user story points is being made sprints after sprint. It helps you predict whether you will be able to smash the project\u0026rsquo;s estimated total points by the end of the last sprint or not. It shows an average velocity for you to compare against but teams normally get a rather non-straight Burndown chart.\n A very simple 4-sprint Scrum burndown chart\n  Scrum Sprints The Scrum Backlog view will always show a summary view of ongoing or closed Sprints but teams generally stick to the Sprint Taskboard view when they are focused on getting things done for that Sprint. Click on either the Sprint name or the \u0026ldquo;Sprint Taskboard\u0026rdquo; button so you can access the very important Sprint Taskboard. Open Sprints appear as shortcuts through the left navigation pane\u0026rsquo;s Scrum icon.\n Sprint taskboard showcasing some user stories and their tasks\n  The Sprint Taskboard is quite flexible and it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of \u0026ldquo;visual management\u0026rdquo;, meaning that is radiates information for the entire team. User Stories are kept to the left and the bigger part of the Taskboard is devoted to a KANBAN-style pipeline for tasks. Those tasks are the individual work components through which user stories are carried out and they enjoy their specific tasks workflow, which can be inspired or not by user stories workflow, as they are separate.\nPlease note that whenever all tasks belonging to a user story are in a Closed state, such user story counts as closed for metrics and velocity regardless of the particular user story status. Speaking of which, the Taskboard has its particular Burndown chart, which keeps track of how fast the team is closing user stories before the end of the Sprint and the traditional Sprint Demo event. It\u0026rsquo;s hidden by default but you can expand it clicking on the histogram icon.\n A sprint with a burndown chart waiting to see actual progress\n  What is always visible is the Sprint stats. For that, Taiga uses a simple bar section at the top. It is pretty self-explanatory but there are two icons that are worth mentioning. The opposed arrows icon allows a team to send any sprint\u0026rsquo;s unfinished work to any other open sprint, effectively closing the origin sprint. It\u0026rsquo;s quite handy although we hope you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use it very often. The poison icon if there just to keep track of the number of tasks labelled as Iocaine by their assignees. Please check out what is Iocaine and why you should use it to declare when a task is particularly challenging for the assigned team member.\nTeam members can collapse both user stories and tasks statuses so that they are pleased with a better use of their screen real estate.\nScrum filters and search options Whether you are at the Backlog screen or the Sprint taskboard screen, you might want to use the built-in search or filter capabilities.\n Sprint taskboard with filters applied\n  Simply click on Filters and fiddle with include/exclude criteria with live reaction from the Backlog or the Sprint Taskboard. You can remove them at any time or create a custom filter for future use, one click away.\nYou can also combine it with the search box that will try to be as smart as possible and show matching content only.\nSprint taskboard zoom levels A Sprint taskboard radiates information to all team members and, most importantly, makes sure that everyone shares the same vision.\nHowever, Taiga users are allowed to pick their preferred zoom level for the Sprint taskboard. You can pick from four options: compact, default, detailed and expanded.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, just see how different the same Sprint taskboard can look depending on your zoom level preference.\n Sprint taskboard with expanded zoom vs compact zoom\n  When you prefer more detailed or expanded zoom levels you are asking Taiga to bring more and more information on the content to the front, saving you that extra click to view its detail. Compact or default zoom levels make the Sprint taskboard more of a heat map of sorts and can accommodate more content in one screen.\nOf course, you can change your zoom level preferences at any time. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry, this is your personal Sprint taskboard view, it does not affect other team members personal preferences.\nYou will probably find yourself sticking to a preferred zoom level most of the time while also collapsing user stories you don\u0026rsquo;t need to see, or tasks statuses that you don\u0026rsquo;t manage.\nScrum relationship with Kanban module Taiga is about choice and flexibility while still adhering to basic agile and lean principles. We want you to start using either Scrum or Kanban for your project (or neither and stick with Issues) and later change your mind.\nIn order for Taiga to manage this transition, we decided that a Kanban work item or Kanban card would also be internally considered a Scrum User Story. That way, you can keep all your work regardless of which Agile module you are using.\nActually, you could have both modules, Kanban and Scrum activated and see the same item placed on the Scrum Backlog or a Scrum Sprint and, at the same time, see it on the Kanban board, in a particular swimlane. As the Taiga Team likes to say \u0026ldquo;if you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, we\u0026rsquo;re fine\u0026rdquo;.\nBe sure to read Scrum, the Dark Side to know more about potential pitfalls while using Scrum.\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/features/introscrum/","tags":null,"title":"Quick intro to Scrum module"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/categories/scrum/","tags":null,"title":"scrum"},{"categories":["modules"],"contents":"If you\u0026rsquo;re after a multipurpose and flexible to-do list Taiga module, check Issues. Some teams love Taiga Issues Module so much that they are fine using it without KANBAN or Scrum modules. Actually, Issues Module is clearly the most used Taiga Module, whether it shares room with Scrum or KANBAN modules, to name the two main Taiga pillars. In other words, Scrum and KANBAN modules somehow compete with each other while Issues is happy to work with any of them.\nSo, what makes Issues Module so successful? For one, it puts screen real estate to good use. Its compact yet visual listing allows team members to quickly decide what to do next. Also, filtering and ordering capabilities are handy and quite powerful. Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s very fast and customisable.\nThe simplicity of Issues At first glance, Issues is just a long list of stuff where pagination reigns. It\u0026rsquo;s when you start using it that you find all the hidden gems. You can activate Issues going to SETTINGS \u0026gt; PROJECT \u0026gt; MODULES and clicking on the Issues toggle. You will immediately see the Issues icon pop up at the upper section of the side navigation bar.\nFirst of all, Issues can contain any type of work item. Don\u0026rsquo;t be limited to \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s not how we see things here at Taiga. You get a default setup for three Issue types you can always change under SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; TYPES. An Issue Type could be a \u0026ldquo;Threat\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Purchase order\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Sales call\u0026rdquo;, it could be anything as long as it feels like a big enough category for the team. For the rest of this article let\u0026rsquo;s assume you are happy with Bugs, Questions and Enhancements, which is quite common in Engineering Projects.\nIssues is not afraid of super long lists, it\u0026rsquo;s meant to cope with that thanks to its 30 items per page. So be free to bulk-add issues if they fit into the default Issue TYPE category. What Issues requires to be useful for teams is to have some attribute setting per issue. Type is mandatory but so it\u0026rsquo;s Severity and Priority, so wisely choose default values for them under SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; [SEVERITIES or PRIORITIES].\nThe default ordering mechanism for Issues unless you click on the other columns is \u0026ldquo;Modified\u0026rdquo;. Any time you create or change an issue, it will bubble up through the list. This means that more active or newer issues appear at the top while long forgotten or closed issues naturally sink in the pagination layout. However, you\u0026rsquo;re one click away to order your zillion issues by Severity or Assigned team member, for example.\nType, Severity and Priority A Task is a task, a User Story is a user story and an Epic is an epic, but an Issue has issue types. At Taiga we think an issue as a simple container that is enriched by type, severity and priority.\n Project settings example for types, severities and priorities\n   Issue Type is a simple major categorisation. Teams tend to pick between 3 and 5 different issue types. This makes early distinction easy and can help manage assignees or workflows. Try to come up with unambiguous issue types that have almost no overlap. Also, it pays off to carefully pick their individual colours. Issue Severity conveys how relevant the issue is. It\u0026rsquo;s the importance ranking. Issues of any type can be minute stuff or game changers. Issue Priority deals with urgency. Regardless of type or severity, how fast should the team be on top of an issue? Teams often mistake Severity with Priority but they are different. Something massive (high severity) could enjoy a fairly low priority and something trivial could need immediate attention.  Please note that you can tweak which are the default selected values for all three attributes under SETTINGS \u0026gt; PROJECT \u0026gt; DEFAULT VALUES.\nFilters Taiga Issues module doesn\u0026rsquo;t sport burndown charts or metrics. Teams that need specific reporting capabilities can use the wonderful live CSV export under SETTINGS \u0026gt; PROJECT \u0026gt; REPORTS or the world-class Taiga API and integrate them into their favourite reporting tool (many use simple spreadsheets and their built-in charts for that).\nWhat Taiga Issues focus on is being able to quickly extract the relevant list of issues for every team member. That\u0026rsquo;s why we have filters box visible by default with all its include/exclude glory. It\u0026rsquo;s here, compared to KANBAN and Scrum, where it\u0026rsquo;s more typical to save custom filters for personal later use. When combined with column ordering you get an extremely fast way to find what you need.\n Hundreds of issues become just a handful. Click to enlarge.\n  \nIn the above example, we go from more than 300 issues to less than 10. We use multiple filters with include/exclude options as well as status column ordering and hide tags. We could even add the search text to further filter but in this case it\u0026rsquo;s probably not necessary since we see everything we need at a glance. If we happened to like to keep this filter, we would simply add it to our list of personal custom filters.\nTaiga Issues Module tips and tricks Every team and every individual decided how to make the most out a flexible tool like Taiga and its multipurpose applicability. Having said that, there a few things we suggest you try out for a better experience and productivity.\n Custom filters: we already covered filters and we touched upon custom filters. Experiment a bit and create two or three handy custom filters. Taiga has a superfast filtering mechanism so why not have multiple one-click-away hyperfocused lists. Cycle over any list: Start with any list, whether there are filters applied or not, then click on any of the issues to go to detail view. Above the \u0026ldquo;Created by\u0026rdquo; text and left to the issue\u0026rsquo;s status, you\u0026rsquo;ll see one or two lateral chevrons. They represent previous and next items throughout the original list you came from. This is present all about Taiga but here is particularly useful for review sessions of multiple issues.   Wonderful previous and next shortcuts with the original list as a protected context\n   Due Date: When you need a fixed due date on top of an issue\u0026rsquo;s priority you can make use of Due Date. Issues have their dedicated custom Due Date entries under SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; DUE DATES. We are planning to add Due Dates as a filtering option but, for now, picking quite distinct due date configuration colours allows for immediate attention-seeking issue spotting. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of tags: A bit of discipline while creating tags (and their matching colours) is an amazing investment for an tidy future. Tags can contain emojis and stand out more easily. Try not to add many tags to any single issue, three or four should be enough, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t add cognitive load to what should always be a straightforward list to take action on.  Issues relationship with KANBAN or Scrum modules Issues Module is definetly a team player and works like a charm as a companion to KANBAN or Scrum (or both!) modules.\nFirst, you can put aside whatever doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right as a user story or a KANBAN card or needs to go through a very different workflow. Issues can help the backlog or the KANBAN board to remain less cluttered for the good reasons. This is one the main reasons Issues Module is so often used by the Taiga community.\nSecond, any issue can be promoted to a user story (or a KANBAN card). You can find that button on the issue\u0026rsquo;s right pane, next to some other available actions such as block or delete. This allows for more fine-tuned workflows, where some petitions can start as a humble issue and fight to become a proper user story or KANBAN card. Or perhaps they were wrongly assumed to be an issue (of any type) and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to create a new user story or KANBAN card and copy the contents, just promote it. Promoting an issue carries over as much information as it is possible so even if it happens well into the issue\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle, you are encouraged to do so with minimal content loss.\nFinally, Sprints can list a selection of attached issues if the team wants to have them handy during the sprint\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle. Not only the team can bring forward existing issues to also show them on the sprint taskboard\u0026rsquo;s view but they can create them here and still find them under Issues. Some teams do this to laser focus what a sprint is about regardless of the dozens of pending issues waiting to be taken care of. It\u0026rsquo;s a filter of sorts, if you think about it.\n A sprint can, at the discretion of the team, host a selection of issues\n  Further reading Taiga Issues Module has enough intrinsic value to be used alone as the key Module for a particular Taiga project but its true potential arises when used it as a great Scrum or KANBAN companion. There are other Taiga Modules we would briefly cover so you know what you might be missing out. We suggest you read The Epic, The Wiki and the Meetup.\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/features/introissues/","tags":null,"title":"Your crash course into Issues Module"},{"categories":["customisation"],"contents":"Taiga includes optional custom fields in its administration panel.

But if you intend to make adaptations or changes, you must provide a (de-facto) zero-cost way to obtain the complete modified source code.

Partial or unfinished work, while perfectly acknowledgeable, is not meant to change the progress metrics that are geared towards delivered value, not time spent.\nThis very binary approach frustrates some agile teams that prefer progress charts to represent any partial progress.\nSome Taiga users have asked to be able to assign points to user stories tasks and keep track of them towards progress. This way, as an example, a user story could be 10 points split up in 2 tasks 5 points each. They would argue that a finished 5-point task could make the user story 50% finished towards sprint and burndown metrics even if the user story is not finished.\nProduct-wise, we continue to evaluate the risks of allowing partial or continuous progress metrics.

We hope it leads you to a better Taiga experience. For a straightforward approach to KANBAN using Taiga please read The 5-min Kanban module overview first.\nWhy would we want to do Kanban? What is Kanban’s promise? Kanban\u0026rsquo;s promise is simple \u0026ldquo;if you can achieve individual empowerment (lean) and clear policies, I can deliver organic succession of finished work while avoiding bottle-necks\u0026rdquo;.\nKanban\u0026rsquo;s promise is deceptively simple and it’s considered to be one of the most challenging Agile methods. The reason is that for a team to fulfill Kanban’s promise, the team has to be much more mature than what is required for Scrum. Actually, it is often seen that some Scrum liturgies are borrowed by Kanban teams as a way to establish a safety net.\nWhat is Kanban and what purpose it serves At first glance, Kanban is a set of columns or states and cards that go from left (initial states) to right (final states). When we picture it, we can instinctively see ourselves creating a Kanban for a personal project, like a book we are writing. We are the sole master of the whole Kanban, we don’t need to ask anyone whether we add a new chapter or a new commissioned illustration. We know when things can move to the next step, we know when things have to be cancelled or restarted and we know when things are done.\n The simplest Kanban is not the most common either\u0026hellip;\n  Kanban tries to solve this at scale, when instead of one person, you have a team of, say, 8 people, and you are all writing the same book. With one key difference, most often you’re writing another person’s book.\nKanban critical challenges The main challenges Kanban implementations face are no real individual autonomy and no clear policies.\nIndividual empowerment in a team is almost always required to have functional Kanban method.\nBy individual empowerment we don’t mean that every individual is the master, can make any decision and knows it all. Taking from the lean approach, we mean that every individual is trusted with the most autonomy that is possible within a specific workflow. In Kanban, autonomy comes with responsibility but also with freedom. This makes sense, without some degree of freedom, the concept of responsibility is devoid of any purpose.\nThis freedom is individually exercised and collectively enjoyed.\nWhat is the waste issue and how Kanban deals with it? In Agile (and so it applies to Kanban) waste is undesired sub-product of a development process that reduces future delivered value, increments technical debt and introduces friction in team dynamics. It leads to frustration, disorientation and lack of predictability.\nExamples of waste: meetings with almost no value for at least one participant. Many and undistinguishable communication channels. Context switching. Rushed work item closure. Chinese whispers around key decisions. Fine-grain work item effort estimation. Lack of peer review or leaving all quality controls to a team member. Long term planning.\nKanban is also faced with the waste issue. The way Kanban tackles with it is to have a clear set of policies that can be enforced by any individual at any time without giving it much thought. Kanban streamlines the decision making process and functions as a set of triggers and reactions.\nA policy is a rule or a set of rules that determines what to do with a Kanban work item depending on a particular state or event. We say it is a clear policy not simply when it is deterministic (this is very difficult to achieve) but when any individual would implement it the same way in the future.\nYou have autonomous individuals when they are free to interpret the best way to apply a policy.\nIsn’t this a contradiction? No, a clear policy embodies a path to deal with the present certainty, while autonomous individuals embody the future uncertainty. Team members in Kanban are like judges. They know the law, they apply it to new cases to their best of their knowledge.\nGood clear policies evolve based on team members feedback.\nFurther reading We would encourage you to read the Taiga Blog\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;Why is Kanban not working for me?\u0026quot; where you will see particular antipatterns that lead to a disastrous experience with Kanban. Your ability to avoid them will surely contribute to not only feel but know you and your team are in control.\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/features/kanbandarkside/","tags":null,"title":"Kanban, the dark side"},{"categories":["scrum"],"contents":"This is content that goes a bit beyond Taiga as an Agile platform and tries to convey a self-conscious approach to Scrum. We hope it leads you to a better Taiga experience. For a straightforward approach to Scrum using Taiga please read Scrum quick intro first.\nWhy would we want to do Scrum? What is Scrum’s promise? It’s always important to remind ourselves the reasons we chose certain behavioural patterns. We\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be testing an hypothesis. Without self-consciousness we\u0026rsquo;re just following some recipes and tools and hoping to improve magically.\nScrum\u0026rsquo;s promise is simple \u0026ldquo;if you can achieve team commitment, I can deliver minimum waste and high predictability\u0026rdquo;. Now, what is team commitment? First, what\u0026rsquo;s not. Team commitment is not \u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo; approach or wishful thinking. Also, team commitment is not a collection of individual commitments. For the Taiga founders, team commitment is the ability to fulfill a promise under tolerable uncertainty conditions and minimum external context switching while doing it as a unity.\nWhat is Scrum and what purpose it serves Scrum provides a number of artifacts to achieve this. Those artifacts can be relatively abstract (retrospective) or more tangible (user story) and can be adapted to the project and team\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nMost people misunderstand Scrum with those artifacts and they believe that by following those recipes, they are doing Scrum and being Agile. The vast majority of the Scrum users fall into this sad category, where Scrum is equivalent to short iteration cycles plus dailies, demos and retros.\n The simplest Scrum action, to move a user story up in the backlog\u0026rsquo;s priority\n  It\u0026rsquo;s true, though, that through form you may achieve soul but there\u0026rsquo;s no reason why you couldn\u0026rsquo;t start with soul and then achieve appropriate form. In fact, many teams start just with Scrum artifacts and through practice they begin to work towards a higher level of \u0026ldquo;enlightenment\u0026rdquo;. They do so as long as they realise they are still far from Scrum’s promise. \u0026ldquo;If you can achieve team commitment, I can deliver minimum waste and high predictability\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;If you can achieve team commitment [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rdquo; Earlier we said Team commitment is the ability to fulfill a promise under tolerable uncertainty conditions and minimum external context switching while doing it as a unity. Let\u0026rsquo;s break that down.\n Promise: the selected user stories from a prioritized backlog that go into a sprint. tolerable uncertainty conditions: user stories are well defined and estimated within reasonable error margins. minimum external context switching: the sprint content is respected by all stakeholders. while doing it as a unity: the team finds solutions for the team, no one is left behind. Either the team \u0026ldquo;wins or loses\u0026rdquo; as a whole. Shared responsibility is not diluted responsibility.   Team members should be entitled to close their own tasks\n  \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] I can deliver minimum waste [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rdquo;  deliver: working software, closed user stories, tangible value. minimum: structurally low quantity. By design. Acceptable. Sustainable. waste: the main enemy to defeat with Scrum (and Agile). Waste is not exactly the opposite of efficiency. Waste is a much more complex concept. Waste can be operational tactical and strategic. Efficiency tends to be mostly operational. A set of efficient behaviours can still lead to waste.  There are tolerable levels of waste, but what is not tolerable is not monitoring it.\nWaste in Scrum (and Agile) It represents the undesired sub-product of a development process that reduces future delivered value, increments technical debt and introduces friction in team dynamics. It leads to frustration, disorientation and lack of predictability.\nIt’s tricky to identify what behaviours or actions lead to waste because, sometimes, a meeting can apparently be a waste generator but turn out to be a waste destructor.\nExample: \u0026ldquo;Aki: I don’t want to go to yet another meeting about frontend for this feature, it’s a waste of my time\u0026rdquo; but later\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Ryu: it was great that Aki was in the meeting, it helped us change our approach, it saved us lots of time!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] and high predictability [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rdquo;  high: extraordinary. Not seen elsewhere. Desirable. Statistically meaningful. predictability: chance of enjoying a satisfactory sprint. Deriving team\u0026rsquo;s average velocity after a number of sprints. Being able to roughly predict when a user story in the backlog, based on its priority (position), will be finished.  Predictability is such a desirable state\u0026hellip; it gives sense of control since we can answer all typical and uncomfortable questions like \u0026ldquo;when will this be\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;how we will be able to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;who should do this\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;.\nEvery single software development methodology swears it will deliver predictability. Old methodologies did this by fixing the future. \u0026ldquo;This is the future, by decree\u0026rdquo;, they would say. Agile doesn\u0026rsquo;t dear to do this, instead it says \u0026ldquo;I promise that, at any point, you will have the biggest value and the smallest waste but I am humble enough not to say WHAT exactly your project will contain as finished user stories\u0026rdquo;.\nThe more waste, the less predictability. The more waste, the more \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo;.\nActually, Scrum might actually be able to predict WHAT exactly your project will contain as finished user stories, but for that you need to have gone through some sprints already and learned about your metrics. Which leads us to the last section of this article.\nPredictable rhythm based on team commitment Rhythm speaks of an activity that enjoys and can sustain a particular velocity or rate. Rhythm speaks of order and not of chaos. Rhythm speaks also of necessary unison and collective coalescence. There is hardly any rhythm if every member of a team acts on their own and for their own sake.\n Even a sprint burndown can tell us how likely are we to close all user stories by the end of it\n  When we say predictable rhythm we mean we can identify the core elements of that rhythm and project them into the future. And we can do this because it is sustainable. A rhythm cannot derive from rush work, or if it can, like a super high rhythm, it won’t be sustainable and could lead to sudden bursts of waste.\nWe can achieve predictable rhythm when there is a sense of purpose because purpose allows teams to anticipate challenges and be ready to sort them out with little effort.\nWhile purpose is always a key ingredient of team commitment, we need to start with team commitment first.\nWe already talked about team commitment in terms of its essence but Scrum has a clear process to achieve it.\n\u0026ldquo;The backlog is the Product Owner\u0026rsquo;s property, the sprint is the team’s property\u0026rdquo;. This means that while the Product Owner is expected to have a good quality backlog, the sprint content is a decision made by the team. When a team says \u0026ldquo;this can go into the sprint\u0026rdquo; it must mean \u0026ldquo;there is a very high chance that we will have this done at Product Owner\u0026rsquo;s satisfaction by the time of the sprint\u0026rsquo;s demo\u0026rdquo;.\nA team can commit to what they have *freely and responsibly aligned themselves to. If they have no say in what goes into a sprint, team commitment doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist and we will simply speak of \u0026ldquo;best-effort\u0026rdquo;.\nAlthough this is very tempting for Product Owners as \u0026ldquo;best-effort\u0026rdquo; could work and requires fewer meetings and explanations, in the absence of team commitment, there is a high risk for a team of alienation and distancing from their results.\nFurther reading We would encourage you to read the Taiga Blog\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;Four Agile Antipatterns and a big fat lie\u0026rdquo; where you will see particular antipatterns that lead to a disastrous experience with Scrum. Your ability to avoid them will surely contribute to not only feel but know you and your team are in control.\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/features/scrumdarkside/","tags":null,"title":"Scrum, the dark side"},{"categories":["kanban"],"contents":"Welcome to a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems, welcome to Kanban. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.\nYou can also say that Kanban is an organic flow of tasks that minimize \u0026ldquo;in progress\u0026rdquo; time thanks to a clear set of rules and a trustworthy team.\nRegardless of how you put it, the reality is that Kanban is a very common way of adopting agile principles because it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to grasp and adapt to your unique context.\nTaiga Kanban module Every Taiga project can activate the Kanban module. This also happens automatically if you chose the Kanban template upon project creation.\n The Kanban module showing an empty initial state\n  When you do this the project\u0026rsquo;s toolbar will show the Kanban icon and you will be able to access the Kanban board. By default the Kanban columns or statuses are ones that generally fit the software development process but feel free to change them yourself. You can create your own set of Kanban columns by going to SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; STATUSES and change USER STORY STATUSES.\n Project attributes setup\n  Scroll down to the USER STORY STATUSES and change the default settings to accommodate your particular use case. If you want your Kanban work items to be considered as done when they reach a particular Kanban status, flag that status as Closed. Also, if you believe a particular Kanban status might end up containing dozens or hundreds of closed Kanban work items, you might want to add an additional status for those and flag it as both Closed and Archived. The Archived property makes a particular Status hide its content by default so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to load no longer relevant content.\n Project settings related to Kanban statuses: Closed \u0026amp; Archived\n  Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to define the Work in progress Limit or WIP Limit for some (if not all) Kanban statuses. This means you are allowing Taiga to monitor whether you are exceeding a particular Kanban status capacity. For instance, Taiga will still allow you to add a fourth work item to 3-WIP Limit Kanban status but you\u0026rsquo;ll get a visual warning on the Kanban board. A Kanban heavily rely on optimal WIP Limits and sticking to them so you don\u0026rsquo;t end up with various work items graveyards that cause bottlenecks. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging to get WIP Limits right straight away so you can always change them later.\n Project settings related to WIP Limits\n  You can adjust Kanban WIP Limits under SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; KANBAN POWER UPS.\nThis is the basic setup. You can now go to the Kanban module and start creating work items and moving them around as they progress in their lifecycle.\nKanban swimlanes Some teams require advanced features for their Kanban boards. One of the most sought after is the Kanban swimlane. It consists on an independant section that can contain a separate set of work items. Taiga allows you to create as many Kanban swimlanes as you need, effectively distributing your work across different major categorizations. Some example of swimlanes usage are sub-teams, project modules, different priorities, etc.\nYou can manage Kanban swimlanes under SETTINGS \u0026gt; ATTRIBUTES \u0026gt; KANBAN POWER UPS.\n Kanban swimlanes configuration\n  By default, a Taiga project comes with no Kanban swimlanes. Once you start creating swimlanes, the top one on the list will act as the default Swimlane for some Taiga project operations. You will also have the option to adjust separate WIP Limits for each one of the swimlanes.\n Kanban swimlanes view with some sample tasks\n  Of course, you can move Kanban work items from one swimlane to another and from one status to any other status.\nKanban filters and search options A Kanban board might get a bit cluttered at times and therefore filters come in handy.\n Kanban with filters applied\n  Simply click on Filters and fiddle with include/exclude criteria with live reaction from the Kanban board. You can remove them at any time or create a custom filter for future use, one click away.\nYou can also combine it with the search box that will try to be as smart as possible and show matching Kanban work items only.\nKanban zoom levels Kanban is very often described as great visual management tool. It radiates information to all team members and, most importantly, everyone shares the same vision.\nHowever, Taiga users are allowed to pick their preferred zoom level for the Kanban board. You can pick from four options: compact, default, detailed and expanded.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, just see how different the same Kanban board can look depending on your zoom level preference.\n Kanban with compact zoom vs expanded zoom\n  When you prefer more detailed or expanded zoom levels you are asking Taiga to bring more and more information on the work item to the front, saving you that extra click to view its detail. Compact or default zoom levels make the Kanban board more of a heat map of sorts and can accommodate more work items in one screen.\nOf course, you can change your zoom level preferences at any time. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry, this is your personal Kanban view, it does not affect other team members personal preferences.\nYou will probably find yourself sticking to a preferred zoom level most of the time while also collapsing swimlanes you don\u0026rsquo;t need to see, or Kanban statuses that you don\u0026rsquo;t manage.\nKanban relationship with Scrum module Taiga is about choice and flexibility while still adhering to basic agile and lean principles. We want you to start using either Scrum or Kanban for your project (or neither and stick with Issues) and later change your mind.\nIn order for Taiga to manage this transition, we decided that a Kanban work item or Kanban card would also be internally considered a Scrum User Story. That way, you can keep all your work regardless of which Agile module you are using.\nActually, you could have both modules, Kanban and Scrum activated and see the same item placed on the Scrum Backlog or a Scrum Sprint and, at the same time, see it on the Kanban board, in a particular swimlane. As the Taiga Team likes to say \u0026ldquo;if you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, we\u0026rsquo;re fine\u0026rdquo;.\nBe sure to read KANBAN, the Dark Side to know more about potential pitfalls while using KANBAN.\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/features/5minkanban/","tags":null,"title":"The 5-min Kanban module overview"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Page for Getting Started\n","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/getting-started/","tags":null,"title":"Getting Started"},{"categories":["customisation"],"contents":"Taiga includes optional custom fields in its administration panel.

This document explains how to deploy a full Taiga service for a production environment with docker.\nRequirements and caveats Prior to start the installation, ensure you have installed:\n docker docker-compose  Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to have familiarity with Docker, docker-compose and Docker repositories.\nGet repository Clone this repository.\n$ cd taiga-docker/ $ git checkout stable Configuration There are two options to configurate taiga-docker, a simple and a complex configuration:\nSimple configuration: This configuration is likely to suit what you need. Edit environment variables in docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-inits.yml. Have in mind that some of the variables are in both files, and you need to edit both.\ntaiga-db This service is for configuring the database.\nPOSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD vars will be used to create the database for Taiga.\n These vars should have the same values as taiga-back vars.\n taiga-back and taiga-async This services are for the REST API endpoints and the async tasks respectively.\nDatabase settings: POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD will be used to connect to the Taiga database.\n These vars should have the same values as taiga-db service vars.\n POSTGRES_HOST is where the database is set. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be in the same host as the database service so it uses internal docker names.\nTaiga settings: TAIGA_SECRET_KEY is the secret key of Taiga. Should be the same as this var in taiga-events and taiga-async. Besides, this should have the same value of SECRET_KEY in taiga-protected.\nTAIGA_SITES_SCHEME, TAIGA_SITES_DOMAIN should have the url where this is served: https[://]taiga.mycompany.com\nRegistration Settings: PUBLIC_REGISTER_ENABLED to allow a public register when you configure this variable to \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo;. By default is \u0026ldquo;False\u0026rdquo;. Should be the same as this var in taiga-front.\nTelemetry Settings: Telemetry anonymous data is collected in order to learn about the use of Taiga and improve the platform based on real scenarios. ENABLE_TELEMETRY could be opt out by setting this variable to \u0026ldquo;False\u0026rdquo;. By default is \u0026ldquo;True\u0026rdquo;.\nEmail Settings: By default, email is configured with the console backend, which means that the emails will be shown in the stdout. If you have an smtp service, uncomment the \u0026ldquo;Email settings\u0026rdquo; section in docker-compose.yml and configure those environment variables:\nDEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_USE_SSL. Uncomment EMAIL_BACKEND variable, but do not modify unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nRabbit settings: RABBITMQ_USER, RABBITMQ_PASS are used to leave messages in the rabbitmq services. Those variables should be the same as in taiga-async-rabbitmq and taiga-events-rabbitmq.\nGithub settings: GITHUB_API_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_API_CLIENT_SECRET used for login with Github. Get these in your profile https://github.com/settings/apps or in your organization profile https://github.com/organizations/{ORGANIZATION-SLUG}/settings/applications\nGitlab settings: GITLAB_API_CLIENT_ID, GITLAB_API_CLIENT_SECRET, GITLAB_URL used for login with GitLab. Get these in your profile https://{YOUR-GITLAB}/profile/applications or in your organization profile https://{YOUR-GITLAB}/admin/applications\nImporters: It\u0026rsquo;s possible to configure different platforms to import projects from them. Make sure that ENABLE_XXXX_IMPORTER envvar is configured in both taiga-back (x-environment) and taiga-front. In taiga-back environment variables, it\u0026rsquo;s also necessary to configure different settings depending on the importer.\ntaiga-async-rabbitmq Configure this service to generate messages from rabbitmq for taiga-async.\nRABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE is the secret erlang cookie.\nRABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER, RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS, RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST will be used to connect to rabbitmq.\ntaiga-front This service is for configuring the frontend application.\nTaiga settings: TAIGA_URL is where this Taiga instance should be served. It should be the same as TAIGA_SITES_SCHEME://TAIGA_SITES_DOMAIN.\nTAIGA_WEBSOCKETS_URL to connect to the events. This should have the same value as TAIGA_SITES_DOMAIN, ie: ws://taiga.mycompany.com\nRegistration Settings: PUBLIC_REGISTER_ENABLED to allow a public register, configure this variable to \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo;. By default is \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;. Should be the same as this var in taiga-back.\nGithub settings: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID used for login with Github. Get these in your profile https://github.com/settings/apps or in your organization profile https://github.com/organizations/{ORGANIZATION-SLUG}/settings/applications\nGitlab settings: GITLAB_CLIENT_ID, GITLAB_URL used for login with GitLab. Get these in your profile https://{YOUR-GITLAB}/profile/applications or in your organization profile https://{YOUR-GITLAB}/admin/applications\nImporters: It\u0026rsquo;s possible to configure different platforms to import projects from them. Make sure that ENABLE_XXXX_IMPORTER envvar is configured in both taiga-back (x-environment) and taiga-front.\ntaiga-protected Configure this service and protects the attachments from external downloads.\nSECRET_KEY should be the same as this var in taiga-back.\nMAX_AGE variable does that the attachments will be accesible with a token during a maximum (in seconds). After that, the token will expire.\ntaiga-events Configure this service for Taiga websocket server which allows taiga-front to show realtime changes in the backlog, taskboard, kanban and issues listing.\nRABBITMQ_USER, RABBITMQ_PASS are used to read messages from rabbitmq.\nTAIGA_SECRET_KEY should be the same as this var in taiga-back.\ntaiga-events-rabbitmq Configure this service to generate messages from rabbitmq for taiga-events.\nRABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE is the secret erlang cookie.\nRABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER, RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS, RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST vars will be used to connect to rabbitmq.\nComplex configuration: In a complex configuration you ignore the environment variables in docker-compose.yml or docker-compose-inits.yml.\nMap a config.py file From taiga-back download the file settings/config.py.prod.example and rename it:\nmv settings/config.py.prod.example settings/config.py Edit it with your own configuration:\n connection to PostgreSQL connection to RabbitMQ for taiga-events and taiga-async credentials for email Enable/disable anonymous telemetry Enable/disable public registration  Check as well the rest of the configuration if you need to enable some advanced features.\nMap the file into /taiga-back/settings/config.py. Have in mind that you have to map it both in docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-inits.yml. You can check the x-volumes section in docker-compose.yml with an example.\nMap a conf.json file From taiga-front download the file dist/config.example.json and rename it:\nmv dist/config.example.json dist/config.json Edit it with your own configuration and map the file into /taiga-front/dist/config.py.\nConfigure an admin user $ docker-compose up -d $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-inits.yml run --rm taiga-manage createsuperuser Up and running Once everything has been installed, launch all the services and check the result:\n$ docker-compose up -d Go to http://localhost:9000 and check your Taiga Platform is available.\nConfigure the proxy Your host configuration needs to make a proxy to http://localhost:9000. Example:\nserver { server_name taiga.mycompany.com; ... location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_redirect off; proxy_pass http://localhost:9000/; } } ","permalink":"https://taiga-resources.kaleidos.net/30min-setup/","tags":null,"title":"30min Setup"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
